				<h1>So, what is this site about?</h1>
				<p>
					Over the years, I've developed my skills writing small, clean-looking websites that perform a function. The function may be as simple as displaying some information you want people to see, or it could be
					a fully defined, professional website that grabs people's attention. I would like to continue building those skills, but not for websites no one will see - I can help put your idea onto a web browser.
				</p>
				
				<h2>But I already have a program that makes websites; why couldn't I just use that?</h2>
				<p>A lot of websites created using website packages, such as Macromedia Dreamweaver, just aren't as flexible
					as well-designed websites, and it shows. A person who decides to make a website may think it as easy as
					dragging a few images onto a page and labelling them, but a lot more goes on behind the scenes, and it takes
					time to understand what goes on and to be able to manipulate those things. </p>
					
				<h2>What are you offering me?</h2>
				<p>I'm offering my services as a programmer and web designer to help create a website from scratch, or improve upon
					an existing one. Given the right resources, I can make a webpage look however you would like it to. I can edit 
					basic websites or add more complex functionality, such as scripts that run on your page for your user to interact with,
					or even writing PHP programs that can use databases and tailor your website to each individual user.</p>
					
				<!-- TODO edit! -->
				<h2>How do I get started?</h2>
				<p>Firstly, make sure to browse the rest of this website, so that you're sure I can provide what you need. Personal
					details can be found on the "android" page, or you can contact me using the form provided in "Contact". "Services"
					provides a little more information about what I can do for you, and "Examples" shows images of websites that I've created
					in the past. Feel free to contact me even if you're not sure whether you'd like me to help with a project; I am happy
					to answer the simplest of questions. </p>
