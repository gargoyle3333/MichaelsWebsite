			<h1>Android Applications</h1>
			<h2>Android</h2>
			<p>Android is an operating systems used on phones. It is becoming increasingly popular, and is the main competition
				for Apple and Windows phones. It's very versatile and as it becomes more popular, more and more phones support it.
				Even apps that are free for users can make money for developers if adverts are included with the app.</p>
			<h2>Applications</h2>
			<p>As Android gets more popular, so it becomes easier for people to get their ideas onto the phones of people everywhere.
				The simplest ideas could be hugely popular, but developers are generally expensive, so it could be that the best ideas 
				have been unfulfilled. Perhaps your idea for an alarm clock that shows pictures of cats when it goes off is the next big
				thing - or maybe something more realistic -  could make you money.</p>

			<h2>Creating your application</h2>
			<p>To begin the creation of your very own idea, it is a good idea to tell someone you trust about it, to see if it is a good idea.
				You may also wish to create some simple designs using an image manipulation program such as Photoshop; this starts to 
				bring your ideas to life in a way that nothing else will. If you think your application is worth creating, it is worth 
				talking to someone who has experience with creating applications, as it is a lot more tricky than one may think. I would
				be happy to answer enquiries on Android applications, even going so far as to create them, if you are sure you
				want to go into business. For a quote, please see the <a href="contact.html">contact</a> section of this website.</p>
				<!-- TODO fix link, it seems to be inheriting the white of the footer, for some reason.. -->
			<h2>My Experience with Android</h2>
			<p>I have been a long-standing user of Android devices. I think that the combination of an excellent phone operating system
				and open source is a winning move from <a href="http://www.android.com/">Google's Android Team</a>, and I have since learned more of how the system 
				works and how to write applications for it. The applications have been simple, always designed to accomplish a useful task rather
				than to provide amusement, but I'm happy to try anything in the future.</p>
